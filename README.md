# Block Call Easier (FREE)

This Application was created by an independent developer to block/reject calls. Once this app cannot be accepted in the Google Store, because the app break the Google's Privacy Policy (<a href="https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/permissions/">Read More</a>), it must be used only to study, so if you want to use this app, you accept that this app is not to production, so maybe doesn't work well.

Functionalities:
- Read/List Contacts to add in blocked numbers
- Read/List Recent Calls to add in blocked numbers
- List Blocked Numbers and how many times has been blocked
